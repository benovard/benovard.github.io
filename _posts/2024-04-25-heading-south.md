With all my Colombian adventures done it was time to start heading south to Ecuador. The road from Colombia to Ecuador passes through the Andes mountains the whole way so it's a lot of winding up and down mountain roads. Two towns that are only a few miles apart can be an hour drive and thousands of feet apart in elevation. I had to keep stopping to put on my sweatshirt, and then stopping to take it off every time I went up or down a mountain because the temperature changes so drastically. I also ran into my first bit of rain and the first day I got completely soaked so the second day I bought waterproof rain gear that everyone in Colombia has for riding motorcycles.

South America has no shortage of incredible views and it seems like around every corner you see something that looks like it could only exist in a movie. If I stopped every time I wanted to to take a picture it would take me years to get across the continent.

My last stop before leaving Colombia was the border town of Ipiales and a detour out to a small town called Las Lajas built right into the side of a river gorge, and a beautiful church that is built right onto a bridge crossing the gorge.
