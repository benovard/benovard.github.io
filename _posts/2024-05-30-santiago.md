Well after a couple of months and a lot of riding, I finally made it to Santiago!! My last day of riding was a quick hour and a half through the mountains from Valparaiso into Santiago. And by through the mountains I really mean through; there are some very long tunnels along the way. I got into Santiago and stayed at a motorcycle hostel in the city center. The last few days have been sight seeing in the city and doing the paperwork to sell the motorcycle. Santiago is a very nice and modern city with an interesting mix of classic architecture and modern buildings. Chile in general has a lot of modern buildings since earthquakes have destroyed a lot of the classic buildings :(

It also has some pretty incredible sunsets :)

The city is tucked into a little valley surrounded by mountains so you get great mountains views everywhere. There are also mountains that stick up out of the middle of the valley which have been turned into huge parks that are surrounded by the city below. The biggest one has a cable car that you can ride up and across it for even better views. Another has a castle at the top that was built by the Spanish as a fort. They were really cool to walk around and explore.

I really liked Santiago. It was extremely modern and in many ways felt almost indistinguishable from cities in the US or Europe. They also have a great subway system which makes getting around the city really easy. 

My last thing to do before heading home is sell the bike. I found a guy who wants to buy it and ride it back to Colombia, so there is a bunch of paperwork we had to do to get it all settled. And with that my motorycle voyage has come to and end. 10,000 kilometers, 6 countries, and 3 flat tires later and I actually made it to my destination. A lot of people asked me if I thought I'd actually make it and there were a few rough spots but I was confident I'd make it here eventually. It was an adventure of a lifetime.
