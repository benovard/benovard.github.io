I spent a couple days resting in Lima after a long trip through the mountains and desert. I got a fancy (by my standards) hotel so I could relax and have a hot shower for the first time in a while. I got into Lima at night, even though I had planned to get there earlier. When mapping it out, I hadn't realized that once I got to the edge of Lima, it would take another 1-1.5 hours to get to central Lima where I was staying. Lima is a very, very big city, especially when you have to cross the whole thing on a motorcycle in traffic. There was one nice part; riding into the city the highway runs along the ocean so you get a really nice view of the ocean on one side and the city lights on the other.

I had heard not great things about Lima, that it was dirty and crowded, so I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it was. It was very crowded for sure, maybe the most crowded city I've been to, but the central part at least is clean and nice and has some very cool old architecture.

And being a big city means you can find everything you need, which for me meant motorcycle parts and a mechanic. After many kilometers my bike was ready for a tune up. With that and a few other errands done I was ready to continue on the next leg of my journey. But not before watching the sun set over the coast.
