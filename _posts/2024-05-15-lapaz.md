After leaving Lake Titicaca behind I headed on over to La Paz. The crossing into Bolivia was very complicated and tiresome, but I made it through. I then rode over to La Paz, the highest major city in the world! (And not just from the coca leaf). The city sits at a cool 12,000 feet making walking anywhere, especially up the steep city streets very tiring. On the bright side, they have a great cable car system that runs all over the city. It's cheap and easy to use, and it has all the convenience of a subway system except that you get great views of the city while riding it. It's honestly one of my favorite public transit systems I've used anywhere.

La Paz is a nice city built right into the middle of the mountains so it's very hilly. It has lots of cool old buildings and there are street markets everywhere. Everywhere you go there are streets filled with people selling everything you can think of.

Definitely one of my favorite cities I've visited on this trip.
