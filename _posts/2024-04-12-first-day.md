I finally got the bike and got it set up. It's a 2016 Honda XRE300, a bike built exclusively for South America and it's difficult roads. I bought a cheap used Garmin GPS and a mount to mount it to the handlebars. Not the most elegant solution but it turned out pretty good. I also wired up a USB charger to the wiring system to charge my phone and GPS and such.

I went out for my first ride on my newly tricked out bike with some of the other motorcyclists I met. Its maiden voyage! Unfortunately, after a brief ride, this 3 inch nail went right through my rear tire. On my very first day of riding. Fortunately I got in a nice little ride to an overlook of the town first.
