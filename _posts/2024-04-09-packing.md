With all my gear purchased, today was the day to start packing. I am taking a carry on bag with all my clothes, and a checked bag with all my motorcycle gear in it. There was a lot of stuff to buy/collect before my trip. An incomplete list includes: 
* GPS 
* water filter 
* basic motorcycle repair tools 
* GoPro
* international driver's license
* motorcycle jacket/pants/gloves
* small first aid kit
* various other tidbits, as well as clothing and toiletries

The state of my packing and all the things I'm taking:

Crazy to think that everything I'm going to need for the next month or so will have to fit into these two bags.
