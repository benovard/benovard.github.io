After leaving Roldanillo with my bike recovered, I packed up everything onto my bike for the first time and headed south to Cali. I rode up around the Lake Calima above Cali and then took the round down through the mountains into Cali. It's a very impressive view. In Cali I also got my first experience riding in big city traffic. I got to Cali just in time for rush hour. It is a chaotic and stressful experience and if you want to get anywhere on a motorcycle you have to be very aggressive and force your way through every little gap and opening wide enough for a motorcycle. At one point it took me about 30 minutes to go 5 blocks. But I finally made it to my hostel.

Cali is a scenic city surrounded by lots of nature. And it is famous for being the capital of salsa. So of course, a friend of a friend took me out to a salsa bar to go dancing and hear a live band. I did ok I think.

I spent a couple days exploring the city and seeing the sights before continuing south.
