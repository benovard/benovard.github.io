After crossing the Andes into Chile I stopped in a little town called San Pedro de Atacama in the middle of the Atacama desert. It is a vast desert that covers northern Chile and Argentina, and southern Peru and Bolivia. It is filled with volcanoes and many unique geological features. I spent the last couple of days exploring the area and many of the things there are to see. After a couple of long cold days on the motorcycle, I decided to rent a Suzuki Jimny to do some exploring in a more comfortable way and take a break from riding. I've been wanting to try one out for a while anyways since they aren't sold in the US so it was a good chance.

It was nice to have a break from sitting on a motorcycle and to be able to listen to music while driving. I drove up into the mountains to some volcanoes where there are big geyser fields. It was pretty cool to walk around all the geysers and drive around the volcanoes, especially since I was the only person up there.

While driving around out in the mountains I found a hot springs river flowing out of one of the mountains. It was the perfect temperature so I went for a dip to warm up from the cold mountain air.

The last thing I did before heading out of the desert was go check out the Valley of the Moon, a  jagged set of rocks and mountains sticking up out of the desert. There's a road that runs through the middle of it you can drive through and check out all the crazy rock formations. The Atacama desert is a really unique and amazing part of the world that's unlike anything else I've seen so far on my trip.
