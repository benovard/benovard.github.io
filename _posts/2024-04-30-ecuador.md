I spent almost a week in Ecuador, mostly in Quito and Guayaquil. After crossing the border I drove up to Quito, which is a lot of uphill since it is almost 10,000 feet. I got there just during a big rainstorm and got to the hotel soaked. Quito is also much colder because of the elevation. I spent the next couple of days exploring Quito and seeing the sights. I rode the teleferico up to the top of the mountain where you can see the entire city. I also visited the monument at the middle of the world on the ecuator. I officially crossed into the southern hemisphere!

I then began the long ride from Quito down to Guayaquil. It was a long 7 hours, and almost all downhill because Guayaquil sits right on the coast at about 38 feet elevation. I winded down through the mountains and then out across the coastal plains where banana plantations cover every bit of land. The roads are not as good in Ecuador as in Colombia, and drivers are also more hostile to motorcycles in Ecuador than in Colombia, so the riding was not as enjoyable. But I got to visit a friend in Guayaquil who showed me around the city for a couple days and got to go to the beach. I also got to try an Andean delicacy, roast guinea pig.

And with that I was ready to leave Ecuador and head on down Peru. I spent one last day heading down to the border and getting ready to make my second crossing.
